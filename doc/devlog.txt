SQLite join clauses are used query and match data from rows in different tables.
SQLite databases can be relational - tables can be associated using foreign keys.
We have access to the clauses: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.
They can be used to combine columns from related tables in different ways.
INNER JOIN: returns rows from the correlated tables based on a certain criteria, given that there is a corresponding row in ALL the correlated tables.
LEFT JOIN: returns rows from the correlated tables (A and B) based on a certain criteria, unlike INNER JOIN, if there is no corresponding row in B, the row in table B is filled with NULL (In short, all rows in table A will be included)
CROSS JOIN: return from the correlated tables by combines every row from one of the tables with every row from the second table
