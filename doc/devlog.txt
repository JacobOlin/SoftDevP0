SQLite join clauses are used query and match data from rows in different tables.
SQLite databases can be relational - tables can be associated using foreign keys.
We have access to the clauses: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.
They can be used to combine columns from related tables in different ways.

Corrected and cleared up questions/comments from today's review session.

Procedures/protocols to optimize our workflow:
1. We work at home in our separate branch and come to school to have a code review and merge to master. This will
prevent merge conflicts and ensure everyone is up-to-date with the current state of the code base.
2. Functions should do as few things as possible. Someone using the function should not spend more than a few
seconds reading the code/function name/function doc to understand what it does.
3. The only style guide to follow is PEP. If PEP is the law.
